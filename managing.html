                <p>After a Work is deposited, you can no longer edit or delete it. Please keep Works as drafts until you are certain that you’ve included all required metadata and files. If you need to edit your Work after deposit, please Contact Us and together we will determine the best course of action to take.</p>
            </section>

                <h2 id="statistics">Getting Statistics for Your Works</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Log in to Deep Blue Documents</strong><br>
                        Navigate to Deep Blue Documents and click "Login" in the upper right-hand corner.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Navigate to your Works</strong><br>
                        Click the person icon in the top right corner and then select ‘My Deposits’.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>On your My Deposits page, all of your deposited (flagged in green) and draft (flagged in orange) Works will appear. If you’d like to receive monthly download statistics about your deposited Works, click the checkbox near the top. Download statistics for your Works appear below the Work's title. Download statistics are provided for this month and total downloads (since February 2008).</p>
                <p><strong>Please note:</strong> While we attempt to filter out activity by automated web crawlers, it is not possible to completely exclude them. Therefore, download counts may reflect both human and crawler activity.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="restricting-access">Restricting Access to Works</h2>
                <p>Since the Work you deposit is complete and ready for distribution (see "Types of Accepted Content"), immediate and worldwide access is the default (and preferred) status for all material in Deep Blue Documents. But we know situations exist where you might not want to offer immediate access. You can limit access to Works in Deep Blue Documents collections for a period of time defined by the community or collection into which you're depositing your Work. Please Contact Us or your collection administrator to discuss options.</p>
                <p><strong>Who:</strong> University of Michigan (U-M) Users: You can restrict access to U-M users only. While access to the Work’s full content is limited, the descriptive metadata will remain publicly available, allowing others to find the Work through searches.</p>
                <p><strong>How Long:</strong> The length of the embargo can be customized based on the needs and agreements related to the depositing of the Work, in collaboration with the collection's administrator(s) and Deep Blue Documents staff. Contact your collection administrator if you have questions.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="withdrawing-work">Withdrawing a Work</h2>
                <p>Depositing a Work permanently locks both its files and metadata, making any future updates require special assistance from our support team. If you anticipate needing to make changes, it's best to save your Work as a draft using the "Save for Later" option instead of finalizing the deposit. Drafts can be saved and updated, and withdrawn at any time before final submission, giving you the flexibility to revise and finalize your work before making it permanent.</p>
                <p>Withdrawals of deposited Works can be made, but only under extenuating circumstances. Deep Blue Documents is designed to provide long-term, permanent access to the Works you deposit. However, we know circumstances can arise where a Work will need to be removed from view. When this becomes necessary, please Contact Us and together we will determine the best course of action to take.</p>
                <p>Since any Work in Deep Blue Documents may have been cited via its persistent identifier (a Digital Object Identifier, DOI), we will always supply a "tombstone" whenever the Work is requested. The tombstone will contain the metadata for the Work, with one of the following messages indicating why the Work was removed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Removed from view by legal order."</li>
                    <li>"Removed from view by the University of Michigan."</li>
                    <li>"Removed from view at request of the author."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The tombstone metadata will be visible to those who already have its persistent identifier (a Digital Object Identifier, DOI), but your Work and its metadata will no longer be searchable and we will make these Works unavailable for harvesting by services such as OAIster and Google.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="removing-files">Removing a File From Existing Work</h2>
                <p>Though it is possible under certain circumstances, to preserve the historical record of your scholarship, and because others may have cited the old version, the preferred way to handle this is to clearly mark the old, out-of-date version as "Superseded" in both the 'Description' field for the file and add a coversheet (or its equivalent) to the file itself. Please Contact Us for help with this.</p>
