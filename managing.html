                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Log in to Deep Blue Documents</strong><ul>
                    <li>Navigate to <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/documents"target="_blank">Deep Blue Documents</a> and click "Login" in the upper right-hand corner.</li></ul>
                    <li><strong>Navigate to your Works</strong><ul><li>Click the profile icon in the top right corner and then select ‘My Works’<img src="images/managing/ProfileAnnotated.jpg" alt="Deep Blue Documents homepage showing the user profile icon in the top right corner. The dropdown is expanded, highlighting the 'My Works' option for submitting documents."></li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>On your My Works page, all of your deposited (flagged “Deposited” in green) and draft (flagged “Draft” in orange) Works will appear.<ul>
                        <li>If you’d like to receive monthly download statistics about your deposited <a href="glossary.html#work">Works</a>, click the checkbox near the top.</li>
                    <li>Please note: While we attempt to filter out activity by automated web crawlers, it is not possible to completely exclude them. Therefore, download counts may reflect both human and crawler activity. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                    <img src="images/managing/MyDepositsPage.png" alt="Screenshot of the 'My Works' page in Deep Blue Documents, showing all deposited and drafted Works.">
                    <li>After a Work is deposited, you can no longer edit or delete it (including <a href="glossary.html#metadata">metadata</a>). Please keep Works as drafts until you are certain that you’ve included all of necessary metadata and files.<ul><li>If you need to edit your Work after deposit, please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> and together we will determine the best course of action. 
                    </li></ul>
                </ol>

                <h3>Restricting Access to Works</h3>
                <p>Since the Work you deposit is complete and ready for distribution (see the <a href="about.html">About page</a> for more information), immediate and worldwide access is the default (and preferred) status for all material in Deep Blue Documents. But we know situations exist where you won't want to offer immediate access. So, legal requirements U-M is bound to honor (such as FOIA requests) notwithstanding, you can limit access to Works in Deep Blue Documents <a href="glossary.html#collection">Collections</a> for a period of time defined by the <a href="glossary.html#community">community</a> or Collection into which you're depositing your Work. In general, you can restrict access to U-M users only. While access to the Work’s full content is limited, the descriptive metadata will remain available publicly, allowing others to find the Work through searches. The length of the embargo can be customized based on the needs and agreements related to the depositing of the Work, in collaboration with the <a href="glossary.html#collection-administrator">Collection's Administrator(s)</a> and Deep Blue Documents staff. There are other embargo options available but they are only used in specific cases. Please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> or your Collection Administrator to discuss options.</p>
                
                <h3>Withdrawing A Work</h3>
                <p>Depositing a Work permanently locks both its files and metadata, making any future updates require administrative support. If you anticipate needing to make changes, it's best to save your Work as a draft using the "Save for Later" option instead of depositing the Work. Draft Works can be saved, updated, and withdrawn at any time before depositing, giving you the flexibility to revise and finalize your Work before making it permanent.</p>
                <p>Withdrawals of deposited Works can be made, but only under extenuating circumstances. Deep Blue Documents is designed to provide permanent access to the Works you deposit. However, we know circumstances can arise where a Work will need to be removed from view. When this becomes necessary, please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> and together we will determine the best course of action to take.
                </p>
                <p>Since any Work in Deep Blue Documents may have been cited via its permanent, unique <a href="glossary.html#doi">Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</a>, we will always supply a "tombstone" whenever the Work is requested. The tombstone will contain the metadata for the Work, with one of the following messages indicating why the Work was removed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Removed from view by legal order."</li>
                    <li>"Removed from view by the University of Michigan."</li>
                    <li>"Removed from view at request of the author."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The tombstone metadata will be visible to those who already have its permanent, unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI), but your Work and its metadata will no longer be searchable and we will make these Works unavailable to services such as search engines.</p>

                <h3>Removing a File From Existing Work</h3>
                <p>Though it is possible under certain circumstances, to preserve the historical record of your scholarship, and because others may have cited the old version, the preferred way to handle this is to clearly mark the old, out-of-date version as "Superceded" in both the 'Description' field for the file and add a coversheet (or its equivalent) to the file itself. Please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> for help with this.</p>

                <h3>Collection Administrator Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Each Collection can have one or more Collection Administrators who will help Deep Blue Documents staff define specific procedures that best suit its needs. This Collection Administrator can be a faculty or staff member from a school, college, department, research institute, etc. or can be a Library liaison to that school, college or department. We are happy to help you set up Collections and work with you to set up access, membership, and other parameters. The Collection structure is intended to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of individuals and their colleagues, and the U-M Library commits to making Deep Blue Documents responsive to the changing needs and nature of the creative, intellectual, and artistic Works done here. Please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> to get started.</p>
                <p><p>For more information, see <a href="#Collection Rights and Responsibilities">Collection Rights and Responsibilities</a>.</p>
                </p>
                <p>A Collection Administrator can also customize your Collection's interface so you can ensure more than Deep Blue Documents minimum metadata are required. If this is something you would like to explore, please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a>.

                <h3>How to Add Depositor as a Collection Administrator</h3>
                <p>If you are a Collection Administrator, you can add a depositor to that Collection in Deep Blue Documents by following these easy steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    
                    <li><strong>Edit Collection: </strong>
                        <ul><li>
                            To access the Collection you administer, click Edit → Collection and select the appropriate Collection in the pop-up window.</li>
                        <li>Then click on the "Assign Roles" tab.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Assign as Depositor:</strong>
                        <ul><li>Click the "COLLECTION_X_SUBMIT" link next to "Depositors" (X, the Collection number, will vary).</li>
                        <li>Search for and add the person using their uniqname. If not found, ensure they are added as an E-Person first.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Save Changes: </strong>
                        <ul><li>Click "Save" at the bottom to update the depositor group.</li></ul>
                        <p>The depositor should now be able to deposit Works to the Collection. 
                        </p>

                <p>Deep Blue Documents is a partnership between University of Michigan (U-M) communities, the University Library and University administration. Deep Blue Documents content consists of Works and Collections produced by members of U-M communities, which are managed, preserved and distributed by the U-M Library through Deep Blue Documents. Some of the Collections may be subject to institutional guidelines defined by the <a href="https://spg.umich.edu/policy/601.08"target="_blank">University of Michigan Standard Practice Guide</a>, particularly section 601.08 regarding electronic records.
                </p>
                <p>As in all partnerships, it is important that all Deep Blue Documents stakeholders understand and agree to the policies, guidelines and procedures required to build the repository.
