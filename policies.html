                <h3>Version 2.0, 07 April 2025</h3>
                <p>I hereby grant to the Regents of the University of Michigan the non-exclusive right to retain, reproduce and distribute the deposited work (the Work) in whole or in part, in and from its electronic format. This agreement does not represent a transfer of copyright to the University of Michigan.</p>
                <p>The University of Michigan may make and keep more than one copy of the Work for purposes of security, backup, preservation and access, and may migrate the Work to any medium or format for the purpose of preservation and access in the future. The University of Michigan will not make any alteration, other than as allowed by this agreement, to the Work.</p>
                <p>I represent and warrant to the University of Michigan that the Work is my original work. I also represent that the Work does not, to the best of my knowledge, infringe or violate any rights of others.</p>
                <p>I further represent and warrant that I have obtained all necessary rights to permit the University of Michigan to reproduce and distribute the Work and that any third-party owned content is clearly identified and acknowledged within the Work.</p>

                <h2 id="IP Policy">Intellectual Property Policy</h2>
                <h3>Version 2.0, 07 April 2025</h3>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents, the University of Michigan Institutional Repository (referred to hereafter as the Repository), is a service of the University of Michigan Library, provided to lower access barriers and offer the widest possible dissemination for the intellectual and creative output of the University. The Repository also provides appropriate long-term preservation services for that content to ensure continuing access over time. Content is made available through a non-exclusive license granted by the author; there is no transfer of intellectual property rights accompanying submission of content to the Repository.
                </p>
                <p>The authors or their designees grant to the Repository a non-exclusive right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>display and distribute the submission including its abstract and descriptive information in electronic format in accordance with the Repository's policies</li>
                    <li>copy, convert or migrate the submission to any medium or format for the purpose of preservation and access</li>
                    <li>keep more than one copy of the submission for purposes of security, back-up, and preservation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When depositing a Work, depositors or their designees should represent the Work's copyright status in a manner consistent with the University's copyright policy, Ownership Of Copyrighted Works Created At Or In Affiliation With The University Of Michigan (June 6, 2002, approved by the Regents on November 14, 2002). The Repository is committed to open access and prefers that content be deposited without access restriction. However, it will make reasonable efforts to limit access to authorized Michigan users or specific users, if restrictions are associated with a submission at the time of deposit.
                </p>
                <p>The Repository will collaborate with the depositor or their designee to allow submissions to be added to, replaced or removed, to comply with subsequent changes to a Work's access policy or to reflect a revision to the Work. In the event a published submission is replaced or removed, the Repository will retain a descriptive record for citation purposes.
                </p>
                <p>Although the depositor or their designee has the right to remove content from the Repository, we recommend that material be deposited in perpetuity, to ensure continuity of access and citation and to facilitate long-term preservation.</p>
                <p>In addition, the depositor or their designee grants to the Repository the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>share the descriptive information and abstract for the submission in a variety of settings to encourage access</li>
                    <li>enhance descriptive information about the submission to support access</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Repository shall obtain express written permission from the author or their designee to use the content for any commercial purpose.</p>
                <p>In the event of the dissolution of a research group, center, institute, or any other unit that is represented in the Repository, content will continue to be held by the Repository unless individual copyright holders request removal or access restriction.</p>
                <p>In the case of joint authorship, if the individual copyright holders disagree on whether or how their Work is represented in the Repository, content will continue to be held by the Repository in the manner in which it existed at the time of the disagreement until the copyright holders jointly request a change to that status.</p>
                <p>Content deemed to be official University records will be transferred to the control of the University Archives.</p>
