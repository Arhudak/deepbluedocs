This agreement does not represent a transfer of copyright to the University of Michigan.</p>
                <p>The University of Michigan may make and keep more than one copy of the Work for purposes of security, backup, preservation and access, and may migrate the Work to any medium or format for the purpose of preservation and access in the future.

                <h2 id="IP Policy">Intellectual Property Policy</h2>
                <h3>Version 1.1, updated on 2025-04-10</h3>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents, the University of Michigan Institutional Repository (referred to hereafter as the Repository), is a service of the University of Michigan Library, provided to lower access barriers and offer the widest possible dissemination for the intellectual and creative output of the University (the Works). The Repository also provides appropriate long-term preservation services for the Works to ensure continuing access over time. Works are made available through a non-exclusive license granted by the author; there is no transfer of intellectual property rights accompanying submission of Works to the Repository.

                </p>
                <p>The authors or their designees grant to the Repository a non-exclusive right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>display and distribute the Work including its abstract and descriptive information in electronic format in accordance with the Repository's policies
                    </li>
                    <li>copy, convert or migrate the Work to any medium or format for the purpose of preservation and access
                    </li>
                    <li>keep more than one copy of the Work for purposes of security, back-up, and preservation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>When depositing a Work, depositors or their designees should represent the Work's copyright status in a manner consistent with the University's copyright policy, <a href="http://www.copyright.umich.edu/university-michigan-copyright-policies"target="_blank">Ownership Of Copyrighted Works Created At Or In Affiliation With The University Of Michigan</a> (June 6, 2002, approved by the Regents on November 14, 2002). The Repository is committed to open access and prefers that Works be deposited without access restriction. However, it will make reasonable efforts to limit access to authorized Michigan users or specific users, if restrictions are associated with a Work at the time of deposit.
                </p>
                <p>The Repository will collaborate with the depositor or their designee to allow submissions to be added to, replaced or removed, to comply with subsequent changes to a Work's access policy or to reflect a revision to the Work. In the event a published submission is replaced or removed, the Repository will retain a descriptive record for citation purposes.
                </p>
                <p>Although the depositor or their designee has the right to remove Works from the Repository, we recommend they be deposited in perpetuity, to ensure continuity of access and citation and to facilitate long-term preservation.
                </p>
                <p>In addition, the depositor or their designee grants to the Repository the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>share the descriptive information and abstract for the Works in a variety of settings to encourage access
                    </li>
                    <li>enhance descriptive information about the Works to support access</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Repository shall obtain express written permission from the author or their designee to use the Work for any commercial purpose.
                </p>
                <p>In the event of the dissolution of a research group, center, institute, or any other unit that is represented in the Repository, Works will continue to be held by the Repository unless individual copyright holders request removal or access restriction.
                </p>
                <p>In the case of joint authorship, if the individual copyright holders disagree on whether or how their Work is represented in the Repository, the Work will continue to be held by the Repository in the manner in which it existed at the time of the disagreement until the copyright holders jointly request a change to that status.
                </p>
                <p>Content deemed to be official University records will be transferred to the control of the University Archives.

Furthermore, I have conveyed to the Collection members the terms and conditions outlined in those policies, including the language of the standard deposit license quoted below and that the community members have granted me the authority to deposit content on their behalf.

                </h3>
                <h4>This Agreement would be associated with each deposit that is batch prepared by a designee (Collection Coordinator), since the batch deposit process bypasses the standard click-through license in the deposit workflow. It assumes that the designee, not the author, will prepare the batch deposit and the Deep Blue staff member will upload the batch into Deep Blue Documents.
                </h4>
                <p>This Agreement is made by and between the [Collection name]____________ of the University of Michigan (hereinafter called the [Collection]), represented by_____________, the Collection Coordinator (hereinafter called the Designee) and the University of Michigan Library's Deep Blue Documents Institutional Repository (hereinafter called the Repository) and is entered into on this ______day of ________, 20__.</p>
                <p>This agreement allows the Designee to act on behalf of individual depositors and/or the Collection and authorizes the Designee to batch load content to the Repository.</p>
                <p>On behalf of the Collection, the Designee acknowledges having read all policies of the Repository and agrees to abide by the terms and conditions therein. For content entrusted or gifted to the Designee, the Designee agrees that making the content available in the Repository is an appropriate and acceptable extension of its agreement with the Collection, and is consistent with the Designee's charge to provide access to this content. In addition, the Designee has conveyed to appropriate Collection representatives the terms and conditions outlined in those policies, including the language of the standard deposit license quoted below and that the Collection members have granted the Designee the authority to deposit content on their behalf.</p>
                <p>The standard deposit license states:</p>
