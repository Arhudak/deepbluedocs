            <section>
                <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents provides access to the content that makes the University of Michigan (U-M) a leader in research, teaching, and creativity. Works in this repository are openly available, accessible, and preserved in a stable place. By representing our faculty, staff, and student scholars as individuals and as members of communities, Deep Blue Documents is where you will find the best scholarly and artistic Work done at Michigan, preserved by the U-M Library.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="Benefits">Benefits</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Making your Work accessible via Deep Blue Documents will ensure more of your peers can find it (in Google Scholar, for example) and can cite it. When you move your scholarship out from behind paywalls and preserve it for the future, you may find that your research profile is elevated as your Works become more discoverable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Permanence:</strong> Each Work receives a permanent, unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which you can share with others or post to social media, your personal website, and more. You won’t have to worry about broken links, or migrating and re-posting your Work to a new web page if you move to a new institution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensiveness:</strong> Deep Blue Documents supports a variety of formats, and we encourage you to deposit any Works related to your teaching, learning, research or creativity - including articles, chapters, posters, presentations, images, audio and video files, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safe storage:</strong> Deep Blue Documents ensures that you only have to deposit the content once. From then on the U-M Library takes care of backups, compatibility, and format issues. There are some technical limitations to the formats we can support indefinitely, but our commitment to preserving the integrity of your Work exactly as you deposit it is 100%.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control over access:</strong> Deep Blue Documents allows you to limit who can see various aspects of your Work for a given time, if you need to. This is difficult to do on a personal website without hiding the Work completely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Context:</strong> U-M is a destination for the best researchers and scholars, and Deep Blue Documents places you in the larger context of the U-M environment, side-by-side with the scholarly and artistic contributions of your colleagues and students.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The U-M Library provides this service free to you as part of the U-M scholarly community. Further, Deep Blue Documents is designed to meet not only today's demands but also new ones as they evolve. It will continue to grow and evolve to reflect current publishing needs and norms identified by U-M faculty, staff, and students.</p>
                <p>Your Work: discovered, cited, preserved. Deep Blue Documents makes it simple.</p>

                <h2 id="Depositing Work">Depositing Work</h2>
                <h3>Eligibility</h3>
                <p>We welcome Works from all three U-M campuses (Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint). Works can be deposited by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current U-M faculty, graduate students and research staff.</li>
                    <li>Multi-institutional collaborations including at least one participant actively employed by U-M.</li>
                    <li>Proxies designated by U-M faculty and research staff.</li>
                    <li>Undergraduate students, with permission of faculty or staff members.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Individuals can deposit Works into collections. Example: A faculty member who gave a conference presentation can deposit the slides for that presentation, audio and/or video clips of the presentation, a working paper about the research, and so on, all as one package to be identified with a single persistent identifier (a Digital Object Identifier, DOI) to ensure reliable access. The research data that underlies this presentation, however, can be deposited in <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data">Deep Blue Data</a>.</p>

    
                <h3>Student Deposit Process</h3>
                <p>A student’s Work (including undergraduate, master's, and PhD) requires approval from a U-M faculty or staff member before being deposited in Deep Blue Documents. For current and former students, the deposit process depends on both your program and the type of Work you are submitting. Note that depositing student Work requires additional permissions in accordance with <a href="https://ogc.umich.edu/frequently-asked-questions/student-records/">FERPA regulations</a>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LSA Undergraduate Honors theses:</strong> Students should fill out the Honors Thesis Submission form to deposit undergraduate Honors theses into Deep Blue Documents. For further information, students should contact the Honors Program at <a href="honors.theses@umich.edu">honors.theses@umich.edu</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ann Arbor PhD dissertations:</strong> For PhD students on the Ann Arbor campus, the way to deposit dissertations in Deep Blue Documents is via Rackham’s process. For further information, contact <a href="OARD.questions@umich.edu">OARD.questions@umich.edu</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>All campuses - Masters’ theses:</strong> We often work with U-M departments directly to get Masters’ theses deposited on behalf of the students. Please refer to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zGC52nLIpocRexNevKghwiBTz0gTLKtUwKikZHz3RHU/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Masters Programs Depositing Table</a> to see if your program or department already has an established workflow for depositing theses. If your department isn’t listed above, we will upload it on your behalf. We’ll need to hold off until the degree is conferred (unless there’s a special situation, and your faculty advisor agrees that we should deposit it earlier).</li>
                    <li><strong>Dearborn or Flint dissertations:</strong> We work with Dearborn's Mardigian Library regarding thesis and dissertation format checks, and depositing theses and dissertations in Deep Blue Documents. Current or former Dearborn students can start this process by doing the thesis format check form online. Additional questions or requests can be directed to <a href="ask-the-mardigian@umich.edu">ask-the-mardigian@umich.edu</a>. For students at Flint, please refer to the Thompson Library for more information on uploading a Work, or any inquiries.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other materials:</strong> This includes Non-Rackham dissertations, Conference Presentations, Posters, Recordings, etc. For students whose Work falls under this category, we will need to work with you directly. Our current policy is that students need the permission of a faculty member to deposit on their own.Please ask your faculty advisor to email us (deepblue@umich.edu), cc'ing you, with a request for you to upload your Work into Deep Blue Documents. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To get started, contact the administrator of the collection you'd like to add your Work to, or <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service">Contact Us</a>.</p>

                <h3>Types of Accepted Content</h3>
                <p>We encourage the deposit of Works with the following characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Work must be educational, artistic, or research-oriented.</li>
                    <li>The Work must be a completed version, ready for distribution.</li>
                    <li>The author/owner must be willing and able to grant U-M the non-exclusive right to preserve and distribute the Work via Deep Blue Documents.(See <a href="">“Rights Granted to the University Upon Deposit"</a> ) located on the Intellectual Properties page.</li>
                    <li>If the Work is part of a series, we strongly encourage you to deposit other Works in that series so that Deep Blue Documents can offer as complete a set as possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples of these Works include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Articles, preprints, working papers, technical reports, conference papers, etc.</li>

                <h3>Types of Prohibited Content</h3>
                <p>While Deep Blue Documents is dedicated to preserving and promoting the diverse scholarly and creative Works of U-M, certain content types are more appropriately housed in other U-M repositories. Here's a guide to ensure your Work finds the right home:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Sets, Software, Code, Visualizations, Simulations, and Models: For scientific, demographic, GPS data, and similar datasets, <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data">Deep Blue Data</a> is the ideal repository, tailored for Works primarily intended for computational use.</li>
                    <li>Administrative Records: Such records should be directed to the University Archives at the <a href="https://bentley.umich.edu/">Bentley Historical Library</a>, in accordance with <a href="https://spg.umich.edu/policy/601.08">Standard Practice Guide 601.8</a>.</li>
                    <li>Non-U-M Affiliated Works: Only Works affiliated with U-M faculty, staff, or students should be deposited. Materials without such affiliations should be excluded.</li>
                    <li>Works in progress: These will be better served via personal websites or departmental servers which provide tools and platforms for modifying and completing Work.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents may in exceptional cases decline a submission due to technical challenges or out-of-scope content. If you have questions please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service">Contact Us</a> and we will be glad to help you determine the best place for your Work(s).</p>

                <h3>Access Permissions</h3>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents is designed to provide your Work the widest possible exposure, so it is open to anyone with an internet connection for searching. You may, however, choose to deposit your Work but prevent it from being seen in full for a limited time. You may also choose to allow people to find out about the existence of your Work, but not download the Work itself, again for a limited time.

                <section>
                <h3>Understanding Collections</h3>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents organizes its content around collections to simplify the process of depositing your Work and to provide you with the most flexibility for finding Work interesting to you. Schools, colleges, departments, research institutes, and other large groups can create collections in Deep Blue Documents to group related Works at the broadest levels.</p>
                <p>Collections allow people to explore a specific area in depth, or to focus specifically on only the areas they find interesting. So, collections contain the Work of more focused/smaller groups and individuals.</p>

                <h3>Creating Collections</h3>
                <p>Only Deep Blue Documents staff have the authority to create new collections. We strongly encourage individuals to add their Work to an existing Research collection, which is designed to accommodate a wide array of scholarly materials. If you find that existing collections don't suit your needs, please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service">Contact Us</a> to discuss how we can best assist you.</p>
                <p>Remember, the collection in which a Work is placed doesn't affect its discoverability; Works are fully searchable within the repository and indexed by search engines, regardless of which collection they are located in.</p>
                <p>For more information about depositing datasets, software or code specifically, refer to <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data">Deep Blue Data</a>—a repository designed for research data that is primarily intended for machine-readable content, rather than human-readable content.</p>

                <p>To guard against unauthorized access, maintain the integrity of the data, and promote the proper use of that data we have implemented physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.</p>
                <p>While we consider these reasonable measures, no guarantee can be made that they will always prevent invalid access or improper activity. For this reason, wherever possible we delete data (such as information about what Works you have previously viewed) that might cause activities to be linked to you as an individual.
                </p>
