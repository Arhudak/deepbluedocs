            <!-- Overview Section -->
            <section>
                <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents provides access to the content that makes the University of Michigan (U-M) a leader in research, teaching, learning, and creativity.<a href="">Works</a> in this repository are openly available, accessible, and preserved in a stable place. By representing our faculty, staff, and student scholars as individuals and as members of communities, Deep Blue Documents is where you will find the best scholarly and artistic Works done at U-M, preserved by the U-M Library.</p>

                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Making your Work accessible via Deep Blue Documents will ensure more of your peers can find it (in Google Scholar, for example) and can cite it. When you move your scholarship out from behind paywalls and preserve it for the future, you may find that your research profile is elevated as your Works become more discoverable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Permanence:</strong> Each Work receives a permanent, unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which you can share with others or post to social media, your personal website, and more. You won’t have to worry about broken links, or migrating and re-posting your Work to a new web page if you move to a new institution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comprehensiveness:</strong> Deep Blue Documents supports a variety of formats, and we encourage you to deposit any Works related to your research, teaching, learning, and creativity - including articles, chapters, posters, presentations, images, audio and video files, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safe storage:</strong> Deep Blue Documents ensures that you only have to deposit the content once. From then on the U-M Library takes care of backups, compatibility, and format issues. There are some technical limitations to the formats whose functionality we can support indefinitely, but our commitment to preserving the integrity of your Work exactly as you deposit it is 100%.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control over access:</strong> Deep Blue Documents allows you to limit who can see various aspects of your Work for a given time, if you need to. This is difficult to do on a personal website without hiding the Work completely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Context:</strong> U-M is a destination for the best researchers and scholars, and Deep Blue Documents places you in the larger context of the U-M environment, side-by-side with the scholarly and artistic contributions of your colleagues and students.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The U-M Library provides this service free to you as part of the U-M scholarly community. Further, Deep Blue Documents is designed to meet not only today's demands but also new ones as they evolve. It will continue to grow and evolve to reflect current publishing needs and norms identified by U-M faculty, staff, and students.</p>
                <p>Your Work: discovered, cited, preserved. Deep Blue Documents makes it simple.</p>

                <h2 id="Depositing Work">Depositing Work</h2>

                <h3>Eligibility</h3>
                <p>We welcome Works from all three U-M campuses (Ann Arbor, Dearborn and Flint) and Michigan Medicine. Works can be deposited by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current U-M faculty, students and research staff.</li>
                    <li>Multi-institutional collaborations including at least one participant actively employed by U-M.</li>
                    <li>Proxies designated by U-M faculty and research staff.</li>
                    <li>Undergraduate and graduate students, with permission of faculty or staff members. (See <a href="#student-deposit-process">Student Deposit Process</a> below for more detailed information.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Individuals can deposit Works</strong> into collections. For example, a Sociology faculty member who gave a conference presentation can deposit the slides for that presentation, audio and/or video clips of the presentation, a working paper about the research, and so on, all as one Work in the <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/78414"target="_blank">Department of Sociology collection</a>. The research data that underlies this presentation, however, can be deposited in <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data"target="_blank">Deep Blue Data</a>.</p>

    
                <h3 id="student-deposit-process">Student Deposit Process</h3>
                <p>A student’s Work (including undergraduate, master's, and PhD) requires approval from a U-M faculty or staff member before being deposited in Deep Blue Documents. For current and former students, the deposit process depends on both your program and the type of Work you are submitting. Note that depositing student Work requires additional permissions in accordance with <a href="https://ogc.umich.edu/frequently-asked-questions/student-records/"target="_blank">FERPA regulations</a>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LSA Undergraduate Honors theses:</strong> Students should fill out the <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/honors/current-students/graduation/honors-thesis-submission.html"target="_blank">Honors Thesis Submission form</a> to deposit undergraduate Honors theses into Deep Blue Documents. For further information, students should contact the Honors Program at <a href="honors.theses@umich.edu"target="_blank">honors.theses@umich.edu</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ann Arbor PhD dissertations:</strong> For PhD students on the Ann Arbor campus, the way to deposit dissertations in Deep Blue Documents is via <a href="https://rackham.umich.edu/navigating-your-degree/submitting-dissertation/"target="_blank">Rackham’s process</a>. For further information, contact <a href="OARD.questions@umich.edu"target="_blank">OARD.questions@umich.edu</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>All campuses - Masters’ theses:</strong> We often work with U-M departments directly to get Masters’ theses deposited on behalf of the students. Please refer to this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zGC52nLIpocRexNevKghwiBTz0gTLKtUwKikZHz3RHU/edit?gid=0#gid=0"target="_blank">Masters Programs Depositing Table</a> to see if your program or department already has an established workflow for depositing theses. If your department isn’t listed above, we will upload it on your behalf. We’ll need to hold off until the degree is conferred (unless there’s a special situation, and your faculty advisor agrees that we should deposit it earlier).</li>
                    <li><strong>Dearborn or Flint dissertations:</strong> We work with Dearborn's Mardigian Library regarding thesis and dissertation format checks, and depositing theses and dissertations in Deep Blue Documents. Current or former Dearborn students can start this process by consulting the Mardigian’s guide to <a href="https://guides.umd.umich.edu/Word_for_Theses/Common_Corrections"target="_blank">Formatting Your Thesis or Dissertation with Microsoft Word</a>. Additional questions or requests can be directed to <a href="ask-the-mardigian@umich.edu"target="_blank">ask-the-mardigian@umich.edu</a>. For students at Flint, please refer to the <a href="https://libanswers.umflint.edu/faq/205758"target="_blank">Thompson Library FAQ</a> for more information on uploading your work, or any inquiries.                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Other materials:</strong> This includes Non-Rackham dissertations, Conference Presentations, Posters, Recordings, etc. For students whose Work falls under this category, we will need to work with you directly. Our current policy is that students need the permission of a faculty member to deposit on their own.Please ask your faculty advisor to email us (<a href="deepblue@umich.edu"target="_blank">deepblue@umich.edu</a>), cc'ing you, with a request for you to upload your Work into Deep Blue Documents. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>To get started, contact the administrator of the collection you'd like to add your Work to, or <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a>.</p>

                <h3>Types of Accepted Content</h3>
                <p>We encourage the deposit of Works with the following characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Work must be educational, artistic, or research-oriented.</li>
                    <li>The Work is original and does not infringe or violate the law or any rights of others</li>
                    <li>The Work must be a completed version, ready for distribution.</li>
                    <li>The author must be willing and able to grant U-M the non-exclusive right to preserve and distribute the Work via Deep Blue Documents. (See the <a href="terms-of-deposit.html">Terms of Deposit page</a>).</li>
                    <li>If the Work is part of a series, we strongly encourage you to deposit other Works in that series so that Deep Blue Documents can offer as complete a series as possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Examples of these Works include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Articles, preprints, working papers, technical reports, conference papers, etc.</li>
                    <li>Research posters</li>
                    <li>Web-based exhibits/presentations</li>
                    <li>Books and book chapters</li>
                    <li>Dissertations and theses</li>
                    <li>Multimedia</li>
                    <li>Learning objects (typically modular resources used in teaching, e.g. texts, syllabi, websites)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Defining "Original Work"</h3>
                <p>In most cases it's obvious when a Work is original to you, especially when you are its sole author. But some cases can be complex. Other examples of original Work that you may deposit include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annotated or illustrated versions of public domain Works. For example, if a U-M mathematics lecturer added annotations to Alice in Wonderland or an art professor illustrated Moby Dick, both have created a new original Work and we would encourage them to deposit the digital versions of those Works in Deep Blue Documents.</li>
                    <li>Works which you co-authored, such as reports on research done with colleagues at U-M or elsewhere. Unless you grant specific rights (such as the right to distribute) to someone else, the intellectual property is owned equally and in full by all creators.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Prohibited Content</h3>
                <p>While Deep Blue Documents is dedicated to preserving and promoting the diverse scholarly and creative Works of U-M, certain content types are more appropriately housed in other U-M repositories. Here's a guide to ensure your Work finds the right home:</p>
                <div class="indented-content">
                    <p><strong>Data Sets, Software, Code, Visualizations, Simulations, and Models:</strong> For scientific, demographic, GPS data, and similar datasets, <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data"target="_blank">Deep Blue Data</a> is the ideal repository, tailored for Works primarily intended for computational use.</p>
                    <p><strong>Administrative Records:</strong> Such records should be directed to the University Archives at the <a href="https://bentley.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Bentley Historical Library</a>, in accordance with <a href="https://spg.umich.edu/policy/601.08"target="_blank">Standard Practice Guide 601.8</a>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Non-U-M Affiliated Works:</strong> Only Works affiliated with U-M faculty, staff, or students should be deposited. Works without such affiliations will not be accepted.</p>
                    <p><strong>Works in progress:</strong> These will be better served via personal websites or departmental servers which provide tools and platforms for modifying and completing Work.</p>
                    <p><strong>Works that violate the US Department of Justice’s rule on sharing sensitive personal or government-related data:</strong> <a href="https://ogc.umich.edu/frequently-asked-questions/faq-doj-bulk-sensitive-data-regulations/" target="_blank"> Bulk Sensitive Data Regulations</a> prohibit the sharing of Americans’ bulk sensitive personal data (including de-identified data) and US government-related data to countries of concern. Since Deep Blue Documents does not restrict access to Works to people of specific nationalities or by geographic location, we cannot accept data that falls under this rule. This data includes but isn’t limited to: </p>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Human genomic data concerning over 100 U.S. persons and other covered categories of human genomic data on over 1,000 U.S. persons.</li>
                    <li>Biometric identifiers concerning over 1,000 U.S. persons.</li>
                    <li>Precise geolocation data concerning over 1,000 U.S. devices.</li>
                    <li>Personal health data and personal financial data concerning over 10,000 U.S. persons.</li>
                    <li>Specific personal identifiers concerning over 100,000 U.S. persons.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents may in exceptional cases decline a submission due to technical challenges or out-of-scope content. If you have questions please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> and we will be glad to help you determine the best place for your Work(s).</p>

                <p>The U-M Library hosts two repositories: Deep Blue Documents and Deep Blue Data. </p>
                <p><strong>Deep Blue Documents</strong> is a repository for scholarship and teaching materials that are primarily meant to be viewed or consumed by humans, such as articles, curriculum materials, presentations, reports, images, etc. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Deep Blue Data</strong> is a repository for research data primarily meant to be viewed or consumed by computers, such as observations, survey results, simulations, experimental data, etc.
                </p>
                <p>If you’re unsure which repository to use, please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> and we can provide guidance.</p>

                <h3>Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
                <p><strong>You retain all your intellectual property rights (including copyright) upon depositing a Work</strong>. The limited rights you grant to Deep Blue Documents are non-exclusive, and your ability to grant, assign, or retain any and all rights you had before you deposit your Work does not change as a result of your deposit. Please note that some publishers may ask that you grant them exclusive rights to your Work, thus limiting your ability to use it as you see fit and perhaps even limiting your ability to deposit it in Deep Blue Documents and <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data"target="_blank">Deep Blue Data</a>.</p>
                <p>When depositing a Work, depositors or their designees should represent the Work's copyright status in a manner consistent with the U-M's <a href="https://spg.umich.edu/policy/303.04" target="_blank">Technology Transfer Policy, SPG 303.04</a>, and <a href="https://spg.umich.edu/policy/601.28" target="_blank"> Who Holds Copyright at or in Affiliation with the University of Michigan , SPG 601.28</a>.</p>
                <p>When depositing Works, you are required to select whether you’d like the Work to be in the public domain or have a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" target="_blank">Creative Commons license</a>.</p>

                <h3>Access Permissions</h3>
                <p>The Deep Blue Documents is committed to open access and prefers that content be deposited without access restriction. However, it will make reasonable efforts to limit access to U-M affiliates or specific users, if restrictions are associated with a Work at the time of deposit. You may, however, choose to deposit your Work but prevent it from being seen in full for a limited time. You may also choose to allow people to find out about the existence of your Work, but not download the Work itself, again for a limited time. (See <a href="managing.html">Managing page</a>).</p>

                <h2 id="Collections">Collections</h2>
                
                <h3>Understanding Collections</h3>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents organizes its content around <strong> collections </strong> to simplify the process of depositing your Work and to provide you with the most flexibility for finding Work interesting to you. Schools, colleges, departments, research institutes, and other <strong>large groups can create collections</strong> in Deep Blue Documents to group related Works at the broadest levels.</p>
                <p>Collections allow people to explore a specific area in depth, or to focus specifically on only the areas they find interesting. So, <strong>collections contain the Work of more focused groups and individuals</strong>.</p>

                <h3>Creating Collections</h3>
                <p>Only Deep Blue Documents staff have the authority to create new collections. We strongly encourage individuals to add their Work to an <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/13913"target="_blank">existing collection</a>, which is designed to accommodate a wide array of scholarly materials. If you find that existing collections don't suit your needs, please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> to discuss how we can best assist you.</p>
                <p>Remember, the collection in which a Work is placed doesn't affect its discoverability; works are fully searchable within the repository and indexed by search engines, regardless of which collection they are located in.</p>

                <h3>Research Collections vs. Archival Collections – Bentley Library</h3>
                <p>The Research Collections contains collections related to various schools, colleges, departments, research institutes, etc. on all three U-M campuses. The Archival Collections – Bentley Library community contains some of the Bentley Historical Library’s online materials. The <a href="https://bentley.umich.edu/"target="_blank">Bentley Historical Library</a> collects the materials for and promotes the study of the State of Michigan and the U-M. Only archivists at the Bentley Historical Library can deposit Works into their community. U-M faculty, staff, and students may be eligible to deposit into the Research Collections.</p>

                <p>While we consider these reasonable measures, no guarantee can be made that they will always prevent invalid access or improper activity. For this reason, wherever possible we delete data (such as information about what Works you have previously viewed) that might cause activities to be linked to you as an individual.
