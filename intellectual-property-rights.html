            <section>
                <h2 id="formal-policy-overview">Deep Blue Formal Policy Overview</h2>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents supports the University's mission of communicating the knowledge created here to the citizens of Michigan and the world, and does so by offering a service geared towards providing the broadest possible access to our creative, intellectual, and artistic Work. We encourage you to explore all means of allowing others to build upon your Work. When depositing Works, you are required to select whether you’d like the Work to be in the public domain or have a <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org/"target="_blank">Creative Commons license</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Because the topic of intellectual property has specific legal implications, Deep Blue Documents has a formal policy. It has four parts:                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>a <a href="policies.html#IP Policy">Deep Blue Document’s Intellectual Property Policy</a> that formally addresses the concepts outlined below;</li>
                    <li>an <a href="policies.html#Author-Deposit-Agreement">Author's Deposit Agreement</a> used by an author/creator depositing their own Work;</li>
                    <li>a <a href="policies.html#Designee-Submitting-Behalf-of-Author">Designee Submitting on Behalf of Author Agreement</a>, used by a designated coordinator (such as a departmental administrator or a library liaison), and;</li>
                    <li>a <a href="policies.html#Blanket-Agreement-for-Batch-Deposits">Blanket Agreement for Batch Deposits</a> used when an author/creator or designated coordinator deposits batches/groups of Work.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="rights-granted">Rights Granted to the University Upon Deposit</h2>
                <p>When you agree to our standard <a href="policies.html#Author-Deposit-Agreement">Author's Deposit Agreement</a> at the time of deposit, you grant Deep Blue Documents the <strong>non-exclusive</strong> right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>retain, reproduce, and distribute the deposited Work;</li>
                    <li>keep more than one copy of your Work for purposes of security, backup, preservation, and access, and;</li>
                    <li>migrate your Work to any future medium or format for the purpose of preservation and access.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="rights-retained">Rights Retained Upon Deposit</h2>
                <p><strong>You retain all your intellectual property rights (including copyright) upon deposit</strong>. The limited rights you grant to Deep Blue Documents are non-exclusive, and your ability to grant, assign, or retain any and all rights you had before you deposit your Work does not change as a result of your deposit. Please note that some publishers may ask that you grant them exclusive rights to your Work, thus limiting your ability to use it as you see fit and perhaps even limiting your ability to deposit it in Deep Blue Documents and <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data"target="_blank">Deep Blue Data</a>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2 id="original-work">Definition of "Original Work" in the <a href="policies.html#Author-Deposit-Agreement">Author's Deposit Agreement</a></h2>
                <p>In most cases it's obvious when a Work is original to you, especially when you are its sole creator. But some cases can be complex. Other examples of original Work that you may deposit include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annotated or illustrated versions of public domain Works. For example, if a U-M mathematics lecturer added annotations to <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> or an art professor illustrated <em>Moby Dick</em>, both have created a new original Work and we would encourage them to deposit the digital versions of those Works in Deep Blue Documents.</li>
                    <li>Works which you co-authored, such as reports on research done with colleagues at U-M or elsewhere. Unless you grant specific rights (such as the right to distribute) to someone else, the intellectual property is owned equally and in full by all creators.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Related to that, in the third and fourth paragraph of the agreement, you represent that you have the right to make and deposit the Work and that you're not infringing on the rights of others by doing so. If you have questions about the status of your Work, a number of resources exist on campus to assist you, including the <a href="https://www.lib.umich.edu/about-us/policies/copyright-policy" target="_blank">U-M Library Copyright Policy</a>.</p>
