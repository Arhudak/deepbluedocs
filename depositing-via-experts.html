                    <li>On the ‘My claimed scholarly activities’ page, determine if the Work that you want to deposit into Deep Blue Documents is already listed. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>If it is listed, proceed to step 4.</li>
                            <li>If not, skip to step 8.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>If the Work that you want to deposit into Deep Blue Documents is already listed, click the blue ‘Deposit’ button next to the Works name.
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Work won’t have this button if it’s already deposited into Deep Blue Documents - see the Work’s History tab for more information. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Selecting either option is fine. It won’t affect how the Work is deposited into Deep Blue Documents. </li>

                            <li>If your Work was published in a scholarly journal, check <a href="https://openpolicyfinder.jisc.ac.uk/" target="_blank" >Jisc’s Open Policy Finder</a> to determine if the journal publisher requires an embargo period.
