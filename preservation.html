                <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents follows the <a href="https://lib.umich.edu/static/77a0ea6ff710eacd8647790c7f6b9df3/U-M%20Library%20Digital%20Repository%20Services%20Digital%20Preservation%20Policy_0.pdf" target="_blank">U-M Library Digital Preservation Policy (PDF)</a> to ensure the long-term accessibility and usability of deposited materials. File formats are classified into three levels based on their preservation support, as outlined in the <a href="https://lib.umich.edu/static/5107471267e88dec32ae0f4c9d429f2b/U-M%20Library%27s%20Digital%20Repository%20Services%20Registered%20Formats%20and%20Support%20Levels.pdf" target="_blank">U-M Library Registered Formats and Support Levels Document (PDF)</a>.

                <h2 id="preservation-services">Preservation Services</h2>
                <p>For all content you deposit, Deep Blue Documents will provide secure storage, backup, management, fixity-checks, and periodic refreshment by copying Works to new storage media. We will also undertake appropriate format monitoring and provide adequate staffing and other resources to support the services offered. Further, Deep Blue Documents provides a persistent identifier (a Digital Object Identifier, DOI) for all Works.

            <section>
                <h2 id="format-support-levels">Different Levels of Format Support</h2>
                <p>You may deposit a Work in any digital format in Deep Blue Documents, but not all formats can receive the same level of preservation commitment. Deep Blue Documents has designated three levels of support we can offer, based on criteria such as the wide deployment of the format, availability of publicly-documented specifications, and the expectation that tools will be available to undertake controlled transformation or migration. They are described in detail in the U-M Library <a href="https://lib.umich.edu/static/5107471267e88dec32ae0f4c9d429f2b/U-M%20Library%27s%20Digital%20Repository%20Services%20Registered%20Formats%20and%20Support%20Levels.pdf" target="_blank">U-M Library Registered Formats and Support Levels Document (PDF)</a>.

                </p>
                <p>TIFF (.tiff, .tif) is an example of a "Level 1" type of format. Widely used and an open standard, we can support it to our fullest extent. An example of a "Level 2" format is a Microsoft Word document (.docx). Because Microsoft owns and controls the specifications for this format, but doesn't publish them, some features like macros may not operate between versions regardless of our best efforts. Windows Media Audio (.wma), because of its close ties to a specific platform and because it is far less common than MP3 or WAV formats, serves as a good example of a "Level 3" format that we can only commit to preserving at the bit level. In other words, in the future you will be able to download an exact copy of the deposited file, but it may be difficult to open and use it without legacy hardware and/or software.
                </p>
                <p>For a list of all recognized Deep Blue Documents formats and their current support levels, see the <a href="accessibility.html"> Accessibility page</a>. We expect to add to and revise the support levels as standards emerge for digital preservation of additional formats.</p>

                <h2 id="pdf-preservation">Why PDF Isn’t a Level 1 Preservation Format and Why PDF/A is</h2>
                <p>Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF), as you currently generate it using most commercial applications on your computer, is a proprietary format owned and controlled by Adobe Systems, Inc. So despite its wide use, it is not publicly documented at this time. However, PDF/A (where the "A" stands for archive) has been developed as an international preservation standard, <a href="https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-19005-1-pdf-a-1"target="-blank" >ISO 19005-1 for PDF/A-1</a>. We have developed <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/58005" target="_blank">guidelines for creating PDF/A files</a> to which we can apply our highest level (Level 1) of preservation support.

                <h2 id="relationships-in-works">Preserving Relationships in Works with Multiple Files</h2>
                <p>AAt present, the three levels of preservation commitment are made at the individual file level. We will need to evaluate complex content -- Works composed of files in various formats that interact with each other -- to determine whether the operational relationships between the files can be maintained.</p>
                <p>FFor example, when preserving a website in Deep Blue Documents, you must consolidate all web pages into a single directory and update any internal links to reflect this new, flattened structure. This includes renaming files and adjusting link references to ensure the website functions properly as a self-contained entity.</p> <p>Executables and some files that rely on a specific hardware/software environment will also require additional evaluation because not only the format but the access environment must be considered in determining preservation issues. Please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> if you wish to deposit any of these content types.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="digitizing-documents">Digitizing Print Documents for Deposit</h2>
                <p>Deep Blue Documents will focus on new digital materials.</p>
                <p>That said, we encourage collection administrators and individuals (including Library selectors and departmental liaisons) to continue to identify excellent but less current materials, both in digital and non-digital form. U-M has produced a tremendous amount of interesting Works, and that will require prioritization, especially when that Work must be digitized to make it available through Deep Blue Documents. Please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> if you have Works like this and we will work with you to make them available.</p>
                <p>The Deep Blue Documents staff, in collaboration with the Library’s Digital Conversion Unit, may be able to help you digitize print documents and deposit them into Deep Blue Documents, making them accessible in a digital format. The Library doesn’t have the capacity to digitize microfilm.</p>
                <p>For smaller batches (fewer than 100 items or 12 linear feet), the turnaround time is typically 6–8 weeks. Larger batches may be sent to a vendor and could take 6–9 months for scanning and quality review. Processing times may vary depending on batch size and current capacity.</p>
                <p>If you're interested or have any questions about the process, please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service">Contact Us</a>.</p>
