                <h2 id="how-to-deposit">How to Deposit</h2>
            <p>The process for depositing a Work into Deep Blue Documents is outlined below. This process is different for U-M faculty/staff compared to students. To determine eligibility, please refer to the "<a href="">Eligibility</a>" section on the <a href="about.html">About page</a>.  If you are a student, please consult the "<a href="">Deposit Process</a>" on the <a href="about.html">About page</a> for further guidance. For U-M faculty and staff, please follow the steps below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Log in to Deep Blue Documents</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Navigate to <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/documents">Deep Blue Documents</a> and click "Login" in the upper right-hand corner.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li><strong>Start a New Deposit</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open your Deep Blue Documents dashboard by clicking on the menu icon in the upper left-hand corner.</li>
                        <li>Click “Deposit” under "+ New” to begin a new deposit.</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Select a Collection</strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A pop-up will appear prompting you to select a collection.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a collection(s) does appear, select your collection and proceed to step 4.</li>
                        <li>If a collection does not appear, follow the steps below.</li>
                        <li><strong>Note:</strong> New users do not automatically receive these privileges - your collection administrator must grant access.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check the collections list to see if your collection is missing (i.e., you haven’t been added as a depositor by your collection administrator).</li>
                            <li>If the collection is missing, contact your collection administrator to request access.</li>
                        </ul>

            <p>If you can’t find a collection in the dropdown box, you haven’t been added as a depositor to a collection. New Deep Blue Documents users don’t automatically receive deposit privileges—your collection administrator must grant access. Please contact your collection administrator to be added. If you have any other questions, feel free to Contact Us.</p>

            <h2 id="metadata">Enhanced Metadata in Deep Blue Documents
            </h2>
            <p>The U-M Library will only assign additional metadata that can be added automatically. Assigning metadata can be time-consuming and costly, therefore we are unable to do this routinely on a per-Work basis. When the U-M Library finds that we can improve access by enhancing the information about a deposited Work or providing a new context for the Work (such as representing the Work in additional collections beyond the one you deposited it in) or better preserve your Work by changing its format, we may do so.

            <h3>Accepted File Formats</h3>
            <p>All digital formats are accepted, but preservation support varies. Research data should be deposited into Deep Blue Data.</p>

            <h3>File Size Limitations</h3>
            <p>Files larger than 5 GB require staff assistance for depositing. Please Contact Us for help with large files.</p>

            <h3>Prohibited Types of Works</h3>
            <p>Examples include data sets, software, administrative records, and works in progress. Contact Us for guidance.</p>

            <h3>Inserting Special Characters</h3>
            <p>Special characters can be included using system-specific methods described for Mac and Windows users.</p>

            <h3>Batch Upload Process</h3>
            <p>If you have more than twenty documents, staff can assist with a batch upload. Contact Us for more information.</p>
