                <h2 id="how-to-deposit">How to Deposit</h2>
            <p>The process for depositing a Work into Deep Blue Documents is outlined below. This process is different for U-M faculty/staff compared to students. To determine eligibility, or if you are a student, please refer to the <a href="about.html">About page</a> for additional guidance. For U-M faculty and staff, please follow the steps below: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Log in to Deep Blue Documents</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Navigate to <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/documents"target="_blank">Deep Blue Documents</a> and click "Login" in the upper right-hand corner.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li><strong>Start a New Deposit</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Open your Deep Blue Documents dashboard by clicking on the menu icon in the upper left-hand corner.</li>
                        <li>Click “Deposit” under "+ New” to begin a new deposit.</li>

                <li><strong>Select a Collection</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A pop-up will appear prompting you to select a collection.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a collection(s) does appear, select your collection and proceed to step 4.</li>
                        <li>If a collection does not appear, follow the steps below.</li>
                        <li><strong>Note:</strong> New users do not automatically receive these privileges - your collection administrator must grant access.<ul>
                            <li>Check the collections list to see if your collection is missing (i.e., you haven’t been added as a depositor by your collection administrator).</li>
                            <li>If the collection is missing, contact your collection administrator to request access.</li>
                        </ul></li>

            <p>If you can’t find a collection in the dropdown box, you haven’t been added as a depositor to a collection. New Deep Blue Documents users don’t automatically receive deposit privileges—your collection administrator must grant access. Please contact your collection administrator to be added. If you have any other questions, feel free to <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="metadata">Enhanced Metadata in Deep Blue Documents
            </h2>
            <p>The U-M Library will only assign additional metadata that can be added automatically. Assigning metadata can be time-consuming and costly, therefore we are unable to do this routinely on a per-Work basis. When the U-M Library finds that we can improve access by enhancing the information about a deposited Work or providing a new context for the Work (such as representing the Work in additional collections beyond the one you deposited it in) or better preserve your Work by changing its format, we may do so.

                <h3>Proxy Depositing</h3>
                <p>A designated proxy is someone who is authorized to deposit on behalf of another depositor. Follow the steps below to either designate a proxy or deposit as a proxy once you're set up.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>How to Designate a Proxy</strong>
                        <p>To designate a proxy, please Contact Us, specifying the name and uniqname of both the depositor and proxy. Once we receive this information, we will set up proxy access.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Once You’re a Proxy: How to Deposit</strong>
                        <p>Once you're set up as a proxy, you can follow the regular How to Deposit process. However, during the deposit process, be sure to do the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On the New Deposit page, in the field labeled “Depositing As,” select or enter the name of the depositor you are acting on behalf of. </li>
                            <li>Then, simply continue with the regular depositing process as outlined.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

            <section>
            <h3>Accepted File Formats</h3>
            <p>Our goal of providing access to your Work means that Deep Blue Documents accepts all digital formats. However, not all formats can receive the same level of preservation support.</p>
            <p>Note that research data primarily meant to be viewed or consumed by computers should be deposited into <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data"target="_blank">Deep Blue Data</a> (See the <a href="about.html">About page</a> for more information).</p>
            <p>For more detailed information about format support, see the U-M Libraries <a href="https://lib.umich.edu/static/77a0ea6ff710eacd8647790c7f6b9df3/U-M%20Library%20Digital%20Repository%20Services%20Digital%20Preservation%20Policy_0.pdf"target="_blank">Digital Preservation Policy (PDF)</a> and <a href="https://lib.umich.edu/static/5107471267e88dec32ae0f4c9d429f2b/U-M%20Library's%20Digital%20Repository%20Services%20Registered%20Formats%20and%20Support%20Levels.pdf"target="_blank">Registered Formats and Support Levels Document (PDF)</a>.</p>

            <h3>File Size Limitations</h3>
            <p>The size of a file does not matter as such but there are practical limitations. Because of network constraints, depositing files larger than 5 GB requires Deep Blue Documents staff to deposit the Work on your behalf. (For instance, we will want to compare checksums on your file before and after deposit to verify that the file transferred correctly and completely.) We will handle these on a case-by-case basis, so please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> if you plan to deposit large files.</p>

            <section>
            <h3>Prohibited Types of Works</h3>
            <p>The guidelines above are inclusive, and purposely so, as we hope to have Deep Blue Documents represent the U-M intellectual environment as broadly as possible. There are however some Works that you may not be able to deposit or that may find a better home, either temporarily or permanently, elsewhere at U-M. These Works include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Sets, Software, Code, Visualizations, Simulations, Models:</strong> Deposit in <a href="https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data"target="_blank">Deep Blue Data</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrative Records:</strong> Deposit in the <a href="https://bentley.umich.edu/"target="_blank">Bentley Historical Library</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-U-M Affiliated Works</strong>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Works in progress</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Works that violate the US Department of Justice’s rule on sharing sensitive personal or government-related data:</strong> <a href= "https://ogc.umich.edu/frequently-asked-questions/faq-doj-bulk-sensitive-data-regulations/" target="_blank"> Bulk Sensitive Data Regulations</a> prohibit the sharing of Americans’ bulk sensitive personal data and US government-related data to countries of concern. Since Deep Blue Documents does not restrict access to Works to people of specific nationalities or by geographic location, we cannot accept data that falls under this rule. More information on the data included in this regulation is on the <a href="about.html">About page</a>. 
                </li>
                </ul>
            <p>Deep Blue Documents may in exceptional cases decline a submission due to technical challenges or out-of-scope content. If you have questions please see the <a href="about.html">About page</a> or <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> and we will be glad to help you determine the best place for your Work(s).</p>

            <h3>Inserting Special Characters</h3>
            <p>You can include special characters in the title or abstract of your work with a bit of extra effort. Be sure to use a UTF-8 or UTF-16 compatible font—'Arial' is a reliable choice for Roman characters and is widely available on both PC and Mac. The steps to insert special characters is described below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mac
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accented Characters:</strong> Press and hold a letter key (like "a") to see a menu of accented versions (e.g., à, á, â, ã). Use arrow keys to navigate and spacebar to select. You can also use the Option key with other keys for specific accents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Symbols and the Character Viewer:</strong> Press Control + Command + Spacebar to open the Character Viewer for a wide range of symbols and special characters.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Windows
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Using the Character Map:</strong> Press Windows key + S, type "Character Map," and select the app. Search for and select the character, then click "Copy" and paste it into your document.</li>
                        <li><strong>Using Keyboard Shortcuts (Accents):</strong> 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Grave Accent: Press Ctrl + ` (key to the left of 1) then the vowel.</li>
                                <li>Circumflex Accent: Press Ctrl + Shift + 6 then the vowel.</li>
                                <li>Acute Accent: Press Ctrl + ' (key to the right of P) then the vowel.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Using Alt Codes (Numeric Keypad):</strong> Hold the Alt key, type the numerical code on the numeric keypad, then release Alt to insert the character.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Batch Upload Process</h3>
            <p>If you have more than twenty documents that need to be uploaded simultaneously to the same collection, Deep Blue Documents staff can do a batch upload on your behalf. In order to do this, you will need to provide us with a structured spreadsheet of metadata for each Work. We can help you set up a template spreadsheet and a mechanism for systematically collecting Works (including metadata) from creators. See the <a href="policies.html">Policies page</a> for more information. Please <a href="https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDClient/88/Portal/Requests/TicketRequests/NewForm?ID=7Az64AR5TqI_&RequestorType=Service"target="_blank">Contact Us</a> to learn more about the batch upload process.</p>
